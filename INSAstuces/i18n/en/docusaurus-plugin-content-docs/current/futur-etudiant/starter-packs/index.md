## Course Structure

At INSA HdF, the year is divided into **4 periods**. Each period includes core subjects like math and languages, as well as subjects that change throughout the year. Courses are delivered in **lectures** of 1.5 hours, and each subject is accompanied by a **tutorial** (TD) of 1.5 hours to apply the concepts learned in class through exercises. There are also **practical sessions** (TP) in some subjects.

### Evaluation Methods
To advance to the next year, **you must pass both semesters** (one semester consists of two periods). **Exams** are organized at the end of each period and count for a major part of the final grade. **Continuous assessment exams** are also regularly organized on Thursday mornings. All **practical sessions are evaluated** and graded.

**Subjects are grouped into modules**. To pass a semester, you must **pass all modules**. This means having **an average grade of 10 or higher in each module**.

Make-up exams are organized at the end of each semester (in March for S1 and late August for S2).

### Good Study Methods

- **Prepare the tutorials before the classes** to better understand the course. You'll get ahead of those who just take the correction without understanding.
- Ask all your questions in tutorials and lectures! Professors are there to help you if you don't understand a concept.
- Find a balance between group work and personal study.
- Don't wait until the exams to work on what you haven't understood.

-> In summary, work regularly.

:::danger[Attention]
Don't let the workload overwhelm you! Even if it may seem "easy" at the beginning of the year, it's important to organize yourself well from the start to avoid being overwhelmed.
