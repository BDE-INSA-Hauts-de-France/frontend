## The INSA Group

The school initially joined the INSA Group's network of partners before officially becoming an INSA-labeled institution in 2019. The INSA Group is a network of French engineering schools, renowned for its academic excellence and commitment to training high-level engineers.

INSA schools are not just individual institutions! Numerous projects supported by the INSA Group, its foundation, and the AEI (Association of INSA Students) foster **strong connections between schools and their students**. This creates a **national dynamic**, where each INSA student belongs to their school but also to a broader group of students sharing the **same values**.

Each INSA has its own color and mascot! At INSA Hauts-de-France, it's **pink** 🩷 and our mascot is **Barry the caribou** 🫎!

## The History of INSA HdF

INSA Hauts-de-France was established in **2019** through the merger of **ENSIAME** (National School of Engineers in Computer Science, Automation, Mechanics, Energy, and Electronics), **ISTV** (Institute of Science and Technology of Valenciennes), and **FSMS** (Faculty of Science and Sports Professions).

### ENSIAME

ENSIAME was founded in **2002** by combining three engineering schools in Valenciennes: ENSIMEV, EIGIP, and ISIV. This public institution, accredited by the Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur **since 1979**, trains engineers in fields such as mechanics, energy, computer science, and electronics.

### INSA Hauts-de-France

Currently, the school offers:

- An integrated preparatory engineering cycle SHPI (Sciences and Humanities for Engineering)
- 3-year engineering programs
- Bachelor's and master's degrees co-accredited with UPHF
- DEUST degrees
- Specialized master's degrees

## The Mont-Houy Campus During the First World War

### Battle of Mont Houy

The **Mont-Houy Campus**, now the vibrant hub of **INSA Hauts-de-France**, endured a dark and tumultuous period during the **First World War**. Situated in Valenciennes, in the Nord department, this campus witnessed the **devastating violence** of the global conflict. However, it was in **1917**, during the **Battle of Mont Houy**, that it experienced one of the most dramatic episodes in its history.

The **Battle of Mont Houy** occurred in **October 1917**, a pivotal moment in the war, as French and German forces clashed for strategic control of the hill overlooking the region. This battle was part of the Cambrai sector offensive, aimed at breaking enemy lines and reclaiming territories occupied by German forces.

The **Mont Houy**, the highest point in the region, was a strategic location due to its **dominant position**. This made it a focal point for both sides. The campus, then a modest institution, found itself at the center of one of the war's most intense fronts.

The fighting was fierce and relentless. French troops, supported by tanks and infantry, faced strong resistance from German forces. The human toll was significant, and the region's landscape was scarred by **bombardments**, trenches, and destruction.

Today, the **Mont Houy**, a symbol of modernity and scientific innovation, stands as a testament to one of the most brutal battles of the First World War. Reflecting on these events underscores the importance of peace and **remembrance**, vital to preventing such tragedies from recurring. The campus, as a place of learning and progress, remains a living reminder of the history of the **Great War**.
