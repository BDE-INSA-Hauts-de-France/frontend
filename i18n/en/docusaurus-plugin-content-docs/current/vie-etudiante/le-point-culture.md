### ENSIAME

ENSIAME was created in **2002** by the merger of three engineering schools in Valenciennes: ENSIMEV, EIGIP, and ISIV. This public school, recognized by the Commission des Titres d'IngÃ©nieur **since 1979**, trains engineers in fields such as mechanics, energy, computer science, and electronics.

### INSA Hauts-de-France

Today, the school offers:

## The Mont-Houy Campus under the Spotlight of the First World War
### Battle of Mont Houy

The **Mont-Houy Campus**, now the vibrant heart of **INSA Hauts-de-France**, went through a dark and tumultuous period during the **First World War**. Located in Valenciennes, in the Nord department, this campus witnessed the **devastating violence** of the global conflict. But it was in **1917**, during the **Battle of Mont Houy**, that it experienced one of the most dramatic episodes in its history.

The **Battle of Mont Houy** took place in **October 1917**, a crucial moment in the war, when French and German troops fought for strategic control of the hill overlooking the region. This battle was part of the Cambrai sector offensive, aiming to break through enemy lines and reclaim territories occupied by German forces.

The **Mont Houy**, the highest point in the region, was a strategic location due to its **dominant position**. That is why it attracted the attention of both belligerents. The campus, then a small institution, found itself at the heart of one of the most intense fronts of the war.

The fighting was violent and fierce. The French troops, supported by tanks and infantry soldiers, faced fierce resistance from the German troops. Human losses were considerable, and the landscape of the region was marked by **bombardments**, trenches, and destruction.

The **Mont Houy**, now a symbol of modernity and scientific innovation, bears witness to one of the cruellest battles of the First World War. Through the memory of these events, we better understand the importance of peace and **remembrance**, essential to prevent such tragedies from happening again. The campus, as a place of learning and progress, remains a living testimony to the history of the **Great War**.
