Coming to INSA just to work? What an idea!?

INSA is also about associations, clubs, events, parties, trips, encounters, friends, loves, disappointments, joys, sorrows, laughter, tears, memories... **In short, it's student life!** Extracurricular activities will play a crucial role during your years at INSA!

With you, we intend to maintain our reputation as INSA of the Ambiance! 🩷 - and it's not just talk: we won the **Ambiance Award** at the **[High Five](/vie-etudiante/evenements#le-h5---high-five)** in 2023, and at TOSS in 2023 and 2024! 🎉

Our emblematic color? **Pink** 🌸! Our mascot? **Barry the Caribou** 🫎!

Here's a little guide to get you started with life at INSA:
