## The Nuit INSA Association

The Nuit INSA Association is an **emblematic student association** of INSA Hauts-de-France **that organizes two major events** every year for the school community.

### The Christmas Dinner

The first event is the Christmas Dinner, a festive gathering of around a hundred students for a convivial dinner. This evening is enlivened by musical ambiance, performances, and the traditional awarding of the Golden Caribous, humorous prizes highly appreciated by the students.

### The Annual Gala

The second event is the annual gala, a prestigious evening that attracts more than 900 participants. This grand occasion allows graduates to celebrate the completion of their studies alongside other cohorts, teachers, and school partners.

### Member Involvement

Each member of the Nuit INSA Association actively participates in organizing these events. They dedicate their time and energy to various essential tasks. Some are responsible for researching and proposing an original theme for the gala, working on creative concepts that will define the evening's identity. Other members handle outreach and negotiations with local and national companies to secure financial or material support.

Similarly, a team is devoted to **creating a magical atmosphere** in line with the chosen theme. Others take care of **logistics**, **communication**, or **coordination** with service providers. Everyone contributes their skills and motivation to ensure these events are successful and memorable for all participants.

### A Collective Adventure

This collective involvement not only enables ambitious projects to come to life but also strengthens the bonds between association members, who share a common passion for bringing these exceptional moments to the entire school community.
