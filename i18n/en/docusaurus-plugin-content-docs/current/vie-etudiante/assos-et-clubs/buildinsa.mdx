Our goal is to **introduce the world of construction sites** and **general construction** to **Civil Engineering and Building students at INSA Hauts-de-France**, whether they are in the engineering cycle or pursuing a Bachelor's or Master's degree.

To achieve this, the association organizes **site visits** with companies from the construction industry.

It also promotes **meetings between companies and students** to foster relationships between students and professionals.
