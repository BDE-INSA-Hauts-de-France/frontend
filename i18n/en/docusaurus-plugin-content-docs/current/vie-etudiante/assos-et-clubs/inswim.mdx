## Welcome to the INSWIM page, the swimming club of INSA Hauts-De-France!

Whether you are a **beginner or an experienced swimmer**, we offer regular training sessions in a **friendly and motivating atmosphere**. Our goal: to allow all students to **come together around a shared passion** for swimming, while promoting well-being and team spirit.

This year, we have also launched the **sale of swim caps in the club and school colors**, a symbol of unity and pride shared by all our members.

**So don't wait any longer, put on your swim cap, join us, and dive into the adventure with the INSWIM club!**
