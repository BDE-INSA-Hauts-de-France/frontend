The BDA is an association that **highlights creativity and individual talents** in the artistic sphere.

### Music
**Music groups** are formed at the beginning of the year. Whether you're into rock, jazz, or metal, there's something for everyone! The groups rehearse throughout the year and perform at various student events at the school:
- At **afterworks** organized by the BDA once a month
- At the **annual Gala** organized by Nuit INSA
- At the **Les Echos d'Hiver concert**, the BDA's major musical event!

To rehearse and become the best musician you can be, **a music room is available**, which can be reserved solo or with your group. Inside, there are instruments that every association member can freely borrow.

### Art
**Painting**, **drawing**, **sewing**—**groups of enthusiasts** come together to practice their craft. The BDA brings them together and can invest in materials upon request!

### Culture
**Cultural outings** (museum visits, symphony orchestra performances, dance, cultural events, etc.) are organized **in partnership with the cultural service of UPHF**. Reach out to us if there's a place you'd like to visit! ;)
