Our goal is to help you discover various products (alcohols, cheeses, sausages...) from our regions through friendly events.

Throughout the year, we offer 3 different types of events:

- 🍇 Wine tastings in a cellar where you can learn about oenology with the help of a professional wine expert.

- 🌎 Themed tastings where we select products of the same type for you to discover (Rum, West Coast, seafood...) during an event organized by us.

- ☀️❄️ Summer and winter BREAKS, which are the major traditional events of the association. Come and discover multiple traditional products from our regions, including wines, seasonal cheeses, beers, and many others.
