## Cariboushots, the photo club that captures your student life!

Here, our mission is simple: **capture all the highlights of student life**. Whether it's an intense competition, a party where everyone dances (more or less well), a concert, or any other memorable event, we're there, camera in hand, ready to shoot!

But that's not all! We don't just fill drives (sorry BDE), we also train the next generation. **If you've always wanted to understand why your photographer friend fiddles with twenty buttons before taking a photo**, **our workshops are made for you**! Beginner or seasoned amateur, you're welcome to join us.

So, want to see the campus through a lens? **Join Cariboushots and come photograph the life of the school!**

### Feel free to reach out to us for any photo requests, sports events, parties, etc.
