**JINNOV** is the Junior-Enterprise of INSA HdF. Our goal is to offer projects to students so they can apply their coursework, gain *soft skills*, earn money, and discover the corporate world. To achieve this, we directly approach companies to find projects.

Joining us means working on many *fun* projects as a team, having a great asset on your **CV** since companies are familiar with Junior-Enterprises. Finally, it also means joining the largest student movement in France, which is highly committed to various causes and where mutual support is the strongest value.

### Paid projects for students/discovering the corporate world
