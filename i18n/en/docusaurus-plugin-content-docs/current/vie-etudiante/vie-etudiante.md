Coming to INSA just to work? What an idea! 

INSA is also about associations, clubs, events, parties, trips, meetings, friendships, loves, disappointments, joys, sorrows, laughs, tears, memories... **In short, it's student life!**

## Associations
The school places great importance on student involvement in associative life. To allow students to invest in it, no classes are held on Thursday afternoons.

INSA Hauts-de-France is full of student associations to please everyone. Whether you are sporty, artistic, geeky, party-goer, engaged, or all of the above, you will definitely find something that suits you!
