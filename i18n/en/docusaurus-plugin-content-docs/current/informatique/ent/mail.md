 **Use with caution**, this feature is not official and **may be disabled at any time.**

You are at INSA Hauts-de-France but no one has assigned you an INSA email?
However, everyone does have an email address in `@insa-hdf.fr`!

Although you cannot yet send emails from this address, try sending an email by replacing `@uphf.fr` with `@insa-hdf.fr` in your school email address and you will see that you do receive the email.
