Are you starting your first year at INSA Hauts-de-France this year? First of all, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ It's a great experience that's beginning!

If you're on this page, it's because you're looking for more details about the course content, the tools to master for your first year. You're in the right place!

Don't hesitate to check out the [how courses and studies work](/futur-etudiant/starter-packs#how-courses-work) if you haven't already.

## The basics to have before starting classes
- In Analysis (math), know well the methods of **studying functions**, that is, the formulas and methods of differentiation and integration, limits, continuity as well as function analysis. If you didn't take the advanced math option in high school, we advise you to look closely at **Complex Numbers** and finally, a good mastery of **proof techniques** will be very useful during these two years of prep.
- In Algebra (math), it can be useful to review **set theory vocabulary** ($\forall, \exists, \in, \subset, \cap, \cup, \iff, \Rightarrow...$).

        In analysis, the year starts directly with **Complex Numbers**. If you didn't take the Advanced Math option in your final year, we strongly advise you to take a look at the basics so you don't get lost from the first class.

- No pure chemistry courses at INSA HdF. Just review the structures of **crystal lattices**, the **packing** seen in Scientific Teaching in high school.
- In Physics, review your courses on **electricity**, the **2nd law of Newton**, thermodynamics

For optics, algebra, mechanics, electronics, and other subjects, everything will be started from scratch. It is necessary to have mathematical knowledge.

:::warning[Don't throw away your middle school calculator!]

    Some teachers only allow the middle school calculator for exams, so don't part with it.
