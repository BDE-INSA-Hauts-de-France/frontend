Are you about to start your **2nd year of preparatory class at INSA**? Here are some tips to start this new year well!

## How the year works

You should know that this year is special. It is made up of 3 periods of regular classes and the last period is dedicated to discovering specialties. There is no obligation to do an internship at the end of the year.

### Conditions for obtaining a specialty
At the end of the year, you will have to choose an engineering specialty. You will have to rank all the specialties offered by the school and the selection will be based on ranking. **The ranking** takes into account **the 2 semesters of 1A** and **the first semester of 2A**.

## The basics to have before starting classes

- In Physics, review well the **resolution of differential equations**. They will be used in Wave Physics 1 and in Automation 2
- For Wave Optics, Wave Physics, and Electromagnetism, it is important to master the application of **Gauss's and Amp√®re's theorems**, know the formulas & laws that apply to electric and magnetic fields. It is also important to know the **PFD** and **PFS**.
- Automation 2 starts again from the concepts studied in the first year. We advise you to **review the methods and vocabulary** (static gain, Laplacian...)
