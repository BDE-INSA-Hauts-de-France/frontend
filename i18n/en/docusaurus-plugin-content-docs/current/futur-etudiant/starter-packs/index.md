## How courses work

At INSA HdF, the year is divided into **4 periods**. In each period, there are core subjects like math and languages but also subjects that change throughout the year. Courses are given in **lectures** of 1h30 and each subject is accompanied by a **tutorial** (TD) of 1h30 to apply the concepts seen in class through exercises. There are also **practicals** (TP) in some subjects.

### Assessment methods
To move to the next year, **you must have passed both semesters** (1 semester consists of two periods). **Exams** are organized at each period and count for a major part of the final grade. **Continuous assessment exams** are also regularly organized on Thursday mornings. All **practicals are assessed** and graded.

**Subjects are grouped into modules**. To validate a semester, you must **have passed all the modules**. That is, have an **average greater than or equal to 10 in each module**.

Make-up exams are organized at the end of each semester (in March for S1 and at the end of August for S2)

### A good working method

- **Prepare tutorials before class** to better understand the lesson. You will get ahead of those who just take the correction without understanding.
- Ask all your questions in tutorials and lectures! The teachers are there to help you if you don't understand something.
- Find the right balance between group work and personal work
- Don't wait for the exams to work on what you haven't understood

-> In summary, work regularly

:::danger[Attention]
Don't let yourself be overwhelmed by the workload! Even if it may seem "simple" at the start of the year, it is important to organize yourself well from the beginning so as not to find yourself overwhelmed.
