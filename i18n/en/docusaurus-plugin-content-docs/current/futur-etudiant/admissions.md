## Admissions in 1A

Admissions for the first year of the preparatory cycle are done via the **Parcoursup** platform or on the **INSA website for international students**

Our advice:
- Fill in all sections of Parcoursup (the "optional" sections are not really optional)
- Highlight your extracurricular culture, your interests, and your working methods. For your academic results, the records speak for themselves.
- Find out about the type of profiles that INSA is looking for and show that you are the right person, show that you know the school.

### Admission Interviews
If you are among the top candidates for INSA programs, you will likely be invited for an admission interview. This interview aims to refine the rankings and discover future students, their ambitions, and their goals.

No stress for the interview! The goal is to demonstrate a certain critical thinking and culture by showing that you care about current events and future challenges.

The interview is generally divided into two parts: the first where you are presented with an image. You must say what it reminds you of in economic, industrial, and ecological terms. Then, you are asked questions about your personal life: your projects, your passions, sports...

:::info[No interviews for you?]
If you have not been selected for the oral interviews, don't worry, **you still have a chance to be admitted to INSA Hauts-de-France!** However, it will be more challenging to get into more selective INSAs like Lyon or Toulouse.
