## Cycling üö≤

In Valenciennes, cycling is highly recommended! **By bike, everything is close!** The campus is only a 15-minute ride from the city center!

On campus, you will find numerous **bike racks** in front of each building. Additionally, **new covered and secure bike racks** have just been installed. It is recommended to use a sturdy lock to prevent bike theft.
